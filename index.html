          <p> Statistical literacy is an integral part of navigating modern, data rich personal and professional environments. The concerns for foresight and vision of the above whakataukī apply well in these modern data environments. Without adequate skills and awareness, desired data sovereignty and the decolonisation of the data stories told about Māori and Pacific peoples will not be possible [1]. Furthermore, data-assisted decision making with complex statistical models will be inaccessible to the communities most in need of understanding them, and the decisions made with them. Numbers are a global language but the stories they tell have important local power. </p>

        This project has four aims:
        <ul>
            <li>	Development and inclusion of Māori and Pacific data stories in course content and assessment for our large introductory statistics course (<a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/courses/stage1/STATS_101/G">Stats 10x</a>),</li>
            <li>Co-construction of knowledge with students catalysed by personally relevant data stories, to which they can bring their lived experiences and participate as experts in the learning community [2], </li>
            <li>Creation of guiding principles for sharing Māori and Pacific data stories in our course and beyond, and </li>
            <li>Greater awareness of, and confidence in, quantitative kaupapa Māori research methods and culturally responsive data use for our teachers.</li>
        </ul>

<p>
 While there is strong evidence of the value of “Math in a Cultural Context” at earlier levels of education for improving student achievement [3], to our knowledge, there are no similar projects to engage with indigenous and minority groups in introductory statistics courses by presenting them with personally relevant data stories. We hope the guidelines created will form powerful supporting tools for tertiary educators around New Zealand, and globally, to put more local heart into their content and teach globally used methods through personally relevant data stories.

      <p>Meeting other SEED Grant recipients from across the full range of disciplines the University of Auckland offers was incredible. The metaphor for this hui was about lashing our waka together. Just as small boats can come together to support each other across great stretches of te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, the Pacific Ocean,  so to we hope the SEED teams will be able to support and learn from each other so we can all succeed. </p>

          <li>Kauwhata also means 'frame' like the frame you'd set up to hand cloaks upon or dry fish. The graph is this structure we hang the data on.
